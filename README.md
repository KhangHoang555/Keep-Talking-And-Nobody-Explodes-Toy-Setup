# Keep-Talking-And-Nobody-Explodes-Toy-Setup
Remember the bomb defusing game? Ever thought of making a toy out of that? Yeah, our professor got no chill when we showed up with a suitcase and duct tape wrapped battery pack.


The idea was to add different obstacles to the defusing game, so players needed to solve all of to win the game. In our current code, we had 2 obstacles: numpad and joystick.

Besides of that, in order to display information to players, we also had LCD to display time ticking and a speaker for explosion sound.

Improvement:
1) There was supposed to be a manual to go with these codes, we didn't have enough time to photoshop it.
2) We were thinking of making it into a vest. The vest wearer would be the one that read out loud the manual directing the defuser. The vest would also have a piece of mental touching the skin and cause a minor shock if defusion failed. This would generate a bigger pressure to the wearer, allowing for much more intense gameplay. To know how to generate the shock, buy a shock collar and opens it up or Google it or just connects them together through bluetooth or wifi.
